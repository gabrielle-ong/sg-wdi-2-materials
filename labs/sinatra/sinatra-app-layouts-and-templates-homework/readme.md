# Your Own Sinatra App, Layouts & Templates

## Introduction

Now that you've gotten a taste of your first framework, practice is _key_. While you're in practice mode, before you get to your next big project, take opportunities to just spin up a new app from scratch and practice all the setup and syntax you can. The more you do it, the more it becomes muscle memory, and the faster and better you'll get.

## Exercise

- Build a new Sinatra app from scratch that uses layouts and templates, incorporating everything you've learned today
  - Make an empty RESTful controller with one or two views
  - Experiment with building parameters into GET requests and rendering views to see what happens
  - Try building some basic Ruby objects, assigning them a variable, and passing them into views.


#### Deliverable

You should end up with a pretty barebones app, but one that starts up with `rack` and runs.
