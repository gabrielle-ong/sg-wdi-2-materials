# Rails API Lab

## Introduction

> ***Note:*** _This can be a pair programming activity or done independently._

Using what we've learned in the Rails API lesson - about modifying routes and controllers - adapt what you built for your new IMDB app, from this morning, and create an API.

Use the Insomnia tool - [Insomnia REST Client](http://insomnia.rest/) - to test your work and work through your errors, if needed!  Remember, the pattern from earlier: adjust the routes and then the controllers to control the flow of your application and give the user the appropriate response code.

## Exercise

#### Requirements

- Create an `index` and `show` API endpoint for both movies and actors
- Allow for create, update, and destroy functionality for both movies and actors

**Bonus:**
- Try out your API using `cURL` requests

#### Starter code

You can either use the provided [starter-code](starter-code) or use what you created for the Git Team Workflow lesson earlier.
